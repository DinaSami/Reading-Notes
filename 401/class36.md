## Application State with Redux

### Review, Research, and Discussion

What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”?

A Recap about Access Token & Refresh Token
Access tokens are usually short-lived JWT Tokens, signed by your server, and are included in every HTTP request to your server to authorize the request.

Refresh tokens are usually long-lived opaque strings stored in your database and are used to get a new access token when it expires.

Explain 3rd party cookies?

Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a website other than the one you are currently on. For example, you can have a "Like" button on your website which will store a cookie on a visitor's computer, that cookie can later be accessed by Facebook to identify visitors and see which websites they visited

How do pixel tags work?

A tracking pixel (also called 1x1 pixel or pixel tag) is a graphic with dimensions of 1x1 pixels that is loaded when a user visits a webpage or opens an email. ... The tracking pixel URL is the memory location on the server. When the user visits a website, the image with the tag is loaded from this server.

## Terms

cookies : Cookies are data, stored in small text files, on your computer.When a web server has sent a web page to a browser, the connection is shut down, and the server forgets everything about the user.

authorization : Authorization is the process of giving someone permission to do or have something.

access control : is the selective restriction of access to a place or other resource,[1] while access management describes the process. The act of accessing may mean consuming, entering, or using. Permission to access a resource is called authorization.

conditional rendering : JSX is a powerful extension to JavaScript that allows us to define UI components. But it doesn’t support loops or conditional expressions directly (although the addition of conditional expressions has been discussed before).

**Fundamentals of Redux Course from Dan Abramov**

Redux provides a solid, stable, and mature solution to managing state in your React application. Through a handful of small, useful patterns, Redux can transform your application from a total mess of confusing and scattered state, into a delightfully organized, easy to understand modern JavaScript powerhouse.

The principles of Redux aren't new, but they are packaged and presented for you in an easy to use a library that not only elevates your applications but also improves your general understanding of building JavaScript UIs.

In this course, Dan Abramov will show you the fundamentals of Redux, so that you can start using it to simplify your applications.

This is a comprehensive (but simplified) guide for absolute Redux beginners, or any who wants to re-evaluate their understanding of the fundamental Redux concepts.
