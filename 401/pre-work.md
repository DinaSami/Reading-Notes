##  How to Solve Programming Problems?

### A simple set of steps:

1- Read the problem completely twice.
2- Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3- Optimize the manual steps.
4- Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5- Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6- Optimize the real code.

### Read the problem completely twice:

This is the single most important step.  You may even want to read the problem 3 or 4 times.
You want to make sure you completely understand the problem.  A good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else.
I cannot over-emphasize how important this step is!
If you don’t understand the problem, you cannot solve it.  Do not worry about wasting time here, because the better you understand the problem, the easier it will be to solve it.
If you are given any examples along with the problem, make sure you have worked through the examples and understand why the answers are correct for each one.

### Solve the problem manually:

Programming is automation plain and simple.  You may have the ability to skip the manual steps and jump directly to code, but there is a manual process which is the foundation of any code you write.

It is very important to solve the problem manually first, so that you know what you are going to automate, otherwise you are just slinging code around.  Which while can be fun, will make you look like an idiot in a programming interview and will probably cause you to sweat profusely.

### How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving?

*Problem solving is the meta-skill.*

We all have problems. Big and small. How we deal with them is sometimes, well…pretty random.Unless you have a system, this is probably how you “solve” problems (which is what I did when I started coding):

1- Try a solution.
2- If that doesn’t work, try another one.
3- If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

### Have a framework!!

1- Understand : Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step).

2- Plan : Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution.

3- Divide : Pay attention. This is the most important step of all , Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry! Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.

4- Stuck : The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.

5- Practice : Don’t expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!

### 5 Whys Analysis

#### When to Use a 5 Whys Analysis?

You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.

#### How to Use the 5 Whys?

The model follows a very simple seven-step process:

1. Assemble a Team
2. Define the Problem
3. Ask the First "Why?"
4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times
5. Know When to Stop
6. Address the Root Cause(s)
7. Monitor Your Measures
