# TEXT

- Headings and paragraphs

HTML has six "levels" of headings, called h1 , h2 ...etc.

*Example :*

```bash
   <h1>Table of Content</h1>
```
To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening <p> tag and closing </p> tag.

```bash
   <p>This is a paraghraph</p>
```

- Bold, italic, emphasis

Bold :  By enclosing words in the tags <b> and **</b>** we can make characters appear bold.
Italics : By enclosing words in the tags **<i>** and **</i>** we can make characters appear italic.

- Structural and semantic markup

The <sup> element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes.

The <sub> element is used to contain characters that should be subscript.

The <hr> element To create a break between themes â€” such as a change of topic in a book.

The <em> element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence.
