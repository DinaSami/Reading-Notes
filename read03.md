## WireFrames
**A wireframes** *a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.*

## Visual hierarchy
Most web users do not read entire pages.Rather, they skim to find information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for..

**SIZE**

Larger elements will grab users' attention first. For this reason it is a good idea to make headings and key points relatively large.

**COLOR**

Foreground and background color can draw attention to key messages. Brighter sections tend to draw users' attention first.

**Style**

An element may be the same size and color as surrounding content but have a different style applied to it to make it stand out.

## Domain Names & Hosting ##
In order to put your site on the web you will need **a domain name and web hosting** .

*DOMAIN NAME
Your domain name is your web address (e.g. google.com or bbc.co.uk). There are many websites that allow you to register domain names. Usually you will have to pay an annual fee to keep that domain name.

*WEB HOST*
So that other people can see your site, you will need to upload it to a web server. Web servers are special computers that are constantly connected to the Internet. They are specially set up to serve web pages when they are requested.
