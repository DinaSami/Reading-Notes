# HTML

### Structure 

*HTML describes the structure of pages !  To describe the structure of a web page , we add code to the words we want to appear on the page.*

*The characters that goes between angled brackets called **HTML elements** which consests of two tags : oppining tag and a closing tag.*

*For example <p> this is an opening tag and </p> this is a closing tag, and the The characters in the brackets indicate the tag's purpose.*

*There is something called Attributes , which provide additional information about the contents of an element.*

### Etra markup

*Here are some extra markup in html :*

1.DOCTYPE : DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using.

2.COMMENTS : add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser.

3.INLINE : Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements.

### HTML5 Layout

# Headers & Footers <header> <footer>
  *The <header> and <footer> elements can be used for:*
  
  1.The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.

  2.A header or footer for an individual <article> or <section> within the page.

# Navigation <nav>
 
 *The <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.*
  
# Articles <article>
 
 *The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.*
 
# Figures <figure> <figcaption>

*It can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article (not just images).*


### Design and Process

What is **Wireframe** ?

*A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.*

What is **Visual hierarchy** ?

*Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for.*
