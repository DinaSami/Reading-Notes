**What is CSS Frameworks?**

CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on.

**What is Multiple style sheet?**

Some web page authors split up their CSS style rules into separate style sheets. For example, they might use one style sheet to control the layout and another to control fonts,colors and so on. SO You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

*Example :* 

```bash
<head>
<title>Multiple Style Sheets - Import</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
href="css/styles.css" />
</head>
```
Multiple Style Sheets (link)

*Example :* 

```bash
<title>Multiple Style Sheets - Link</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
href="css/site.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
href="css/tables.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
href="css/typography.css" />
</head>
```

*The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)*
*Grids help create professional and flexible designs.*
