##  HTML & CSS : Color

*The color property allows you to style your html webpage and to specify the color of text inside an element.*

You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:

* rgb values : These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up.

* hex codes : These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign.

* color names : There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers.

**Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue.**

### Contrast

*When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.*

Three level of **Contrast** :

- Low Contrast : Text is harder to read when there is low contrast between background and foreground colors. 

- Medium Contrast : For long spans of text, reducing the contrast a little bit improves readability.

- High Contrast : Text is easier to read when there is higher contrast between background and foreground colors.
