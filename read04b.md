## How computers works?

*Computer revolution changes the world , we are using computers everywhere in office , hospitals even in our homes. So it could be great to know how it works!!*
*As pionees of computer science</b> explored how to the design a thinking machines , it had to perform four deffernt tasks:*

1- Take INPUT

2- Store information

3- Process information

4- Out the results

*The earliest computer was made in wood and metal with mechanical engines , by 20 century computer statrs using electrical components , These computer was really large and slow

**uses for computers:**
1- Talk to eachother
2- Play games
3- Control robots

**Types of INPUT**
*All deferrent inputs give computer information to store and memory*
1- Keyboard
2- Mouse
3- Microphones
4- Camera
  
*these information is process then take it to memory with a series of ***ALGORITHM!***

**Type of OUTPUT**
1-Text
2-Photos
3-Videos
4-Games

**Zeroes AND ONES**

*Zeroes and ones do play a big role in how computers work >inside computer a large amount of electric wires and circuits which carry all the information*

**Binary number system**
*in the Decimal no. system there nine no. and in the binary system we have two numers (0 , 1)*

**circuits and logic**
*when the information inputs by input elements then it goes to processing and combining them with eachother , that done using circuits, it takes an electronic signal and flips it.*

**What is CPU?**

*Central processing unit is is the electronic circuitry within a computer that executes instructions that make up a computer program*
