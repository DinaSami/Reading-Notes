## JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY

***JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY*** *make websites more interactive,interesting, and user-friendly.*

### How can Javascrrip makes website pages more intteracctive?

 1-ACCESS CONTENT
 2-MODIFY CONTENT
 3-PROGRAM RULES
 4-PROGRAM RULES
 5-REACT TO EVENTS
 
 *Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in the browser is very powerful. The examples below rely on the ability to:*
 
 1-***Access***the content of the page
 2-***Modify***the content of the page
 3-***Program***rules or instructions the browser can follow
 4-***React***to events triggered by the user or browser
 
 ### What is the script?
 *A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.*
 
####Read this Notes!####

scripts are made up of instructions a computer can follow step-by-step
scripts can run different parts of the script depending on how the user interacts with the web page

### Writing a script?
Start with the big picture of what  you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.

1-DEFINE THE GOAL
2-DESIGN THE SCRIPT
3-CODE EACH STEP

#### Designing A SCRIPT steps, JUST FOLLOW!

### Expressions & Operators

*RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES:*
Here are six rules you must always follow when giving a variable a name:

1-The name must begin with  a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number.

2-The name can contain letters,numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.

3-You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something.

4-All variables are case sensitive,so score and Score would be different variable names, but it is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.

5-Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. For example,fi rstName might be used to store a person's first name,l astNarne for their last name,and age for their age. 
        
6-If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word.

 ### What is array means? 
 
 *An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.*
 
  ### What is Expressions means?
   
 *An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.*
 
  ### EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE 
  
  *EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE*
  
  ### Functions
 
 *What is a Function? Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).*
 
Example:
* A basic function for html and java script*
