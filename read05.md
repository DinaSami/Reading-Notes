# operatos

### 1. Comparison operatos:


*you can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect .The result will be a  Boolean : true or false.*

These are comparison operators:

* Equal to ( == )

* Not equal to ( !=)

* Strict equal to ( === )

* Srict not equal to ( !==)

* Greater than ( > )

* Less than ( < )

* Greater tha or equal to ( >= )

* Less than or equal to ( <= )



  #### Structure Comparison operatos:
  
  
 *in any condition , there is usually one operator and two operands. The operands are placed on each side of the operator. They can be value or variables.*
  
  
   ### 2. Logical operators:
  
  *Comparison operators usually return single values of true or false. Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison.*
  
  These are Logical operators:
  
 * Logical And ( && )

* Logical Or ( || )

* Logical Not ( ! )

  # Loops
 
 *Loops check a condition . If it returns true ,  a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again.
 It repeats until the condition returns false.*
 
 These are Loops:
 
 * For : if you need to run code a specific number of times , use a **FOR** LOOP.

 * While : if you do not know how many times the code should run , you can use **WHILE** loop.

 * Do While : this loop is very similar to the **while** loop.
